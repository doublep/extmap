;;; Commentary:

;; Mapping of symbols to constants that is stored externally as a
;; single binary file and loaded on-demand.  Can be used for huge
;; databases to avoid loading everything to memory.  This package
;; doesn't use any external programs, making it a suitable dependency
;; for smaller libraries.
;;
;; Typical usage of the library consists of two separate stages:
;;
;;     1) Package maintainer/developer creates a map file, which is
;;        then distributed along with its `*.el' etc. files.
;;
;;     2) For end-user, Elisp code retrieves values from the
;;        pre-created map file.
;;
;; Creating a map file doesn't require any external tools.  See
;; function `extmap-from-alist' for details.  If you use Emacs 25 or
;; later and your map is so huge that you don't want to load it fully
;; even when creating, see `extmap-from-iterator'.
;;
;; The main functions for using an existing map file are `extmap-init'
;; to open it and `extmap-get' to retrieve value associated with given
;; key.  See function documentation for details.  Other functions that
;; work with a prepared file:
;;
;;     - extmap-contains-key
;;     - extmap-value-loaded
;;     - extmap-keys
;;     - extmap-mapc
;;     - extmap-mapcar
;;     - extmap-statistics

(defun extmap-init (filename &rest options)
  "Load metadata of a previously created map from FILENAME.

Loaded metadata can be further passed to `extmap-get' and other
functions.  It must be treated as an opaque object: you must not
alter it or make any assumptions about its contents.

OPTIONS can be a list of the following keyword arguments:

  :weak-data

    If non-nil, loaded values are stored in a weak hashmap and
    can be garbage-collected by Emacs if no longer used.  This
    allows to potentially reduce memory usage at the cost of more
    disk operations.

  :auto-reload

    If the backing file is changed, automatically reset the map.
    By default, backing file is supposed to remain constant and
    if it changes, that results in undefined map behavior.

    Reloading doesn't affect any already retrieved values.
    Backing file is considered changed only if its modification
    time is different compared to the previous check, actual
    contents is not checked.

    Using this option slows a map down a little, since it has to
    check file modification time often.  It exists mainly for
    developing, when you'd often re-generate disk files, though
    nothing precludes using it in end-code either.

  :preload-metadata

    Immediately parse the header of the extmap file.  Otherwise
    this is done lazily, on first access.  For consistency, it is
    still an error if FILENAME points to an unreadable file.

The file must remain accessible in case `extmap-get' needs to
load a value later.  There is no need to somehow close a map:
just stop using it."

Created map is stored to file specified by FILENAME.  Later this

DATA must be an alist with symbols used as keys.  All symbols
must be interned in the default obarray.  Values must be
serializable with `print'/`read' (e.g. no buffers or non-interned
symbols), but are otherwise not restricted.

OPTIONS can be a list of the following keyword arguments:

  :overwrite

    By default, this function will signal an error if the output
    file already exists.  However, you can order it to
    overwrite (not merge!) the file.

  :share-values

    When values for different keys are equal, store only one copy
    in the database.  This can decrease database size, but you
    must be prepared that `extmap-get' can return `eq' values for
    different keys (for this reason, this is not the default).

  :compress-values

    Replace equal parts within values with the same object.  This
    can decrease database size, but you must be prepared that
    values returned `extmap-get' can contain `eq' elements (in
    lists, vectors, etc.).  It also makes map creation noticeably
    slower.  For these reason, this is not the default.

  :max-inline-bytes

    Inline values for which `print' results in this many bytes.
    Inlined values are loaded by `extmap-init' immediately and
    don't require additional disk access later.  Default value is
    currently 16, but can be changed in a future package version.
